# geek-text
CEN 4010 Software Engineering Group Project: An online web application bookstore.

## Getting Started with this repo
There are two ways to get this project up and running locally.

Either way, the first thing you'll need to do is clone the repo and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NSuri1/geek-text.git
cd geek-text
cd server
npm i
cd ../client
npm i
cd ..
```

You also have to add some required environment variables for the server to run properly with Mongo.

```bash
touch server/.env
echo MONGODB_USERNAME={enter_username_here} >> server/.env
echo MONGODB_PASSWORD={password} >> server/.env
echo MONGODB_URL={something.mlab.com:23534} >> server/.env
echo MONGODB_TABLE_NAME={geek-text} >> server/.env
```

Now that all that is done, we should be able to start up the project. Here are the aforementioned two ways to run it (both from the root of the project):

1. Using docker-compose (Mostly used by us when deploying to production)
   
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Now you can head over to http://localhost:80 and you should be able to see the project running.

2. Using npm scripts (Mostly used by us for development)

For this approach you'll need two terminal windows, one to run the client, and one to run the server.

In the first terminal window:
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```
And then in the second terminal window:
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

Now you can head over to http://localhost:3000 and you should be able to see the project running.
